# Pathfinder Kingdom Manager
Have you ever tried to manage your own Kingdom in Pathfinder?
Have you created countless spreadsheets or notes to keep the overview just to
notice that you have miscalculated somewhere and find the error?

Me too. That's why i created the Pathfinder Kingdom Manager. Web application
that helps you keep the overview and is simple to use for everyone.
